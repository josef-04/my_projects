## About Me

As a computer engineering student, I have an intense interest in programming, Linux, and cybersecurity. I aim to master various computer science and engineering skills, experiment with open-source software, and have an understanding of how systems function at a basic level. Cybersecurity is a particular interest of mine, and I'm always looking to deepen my knowledge in this field.
